# Lucky-Guesser-iOS-App

Lucky Guesser for iOS was my first iOS app and the first project that I started and finnished all by myself. It was done in the summer of 2018, when I was 19 years old. The main goal with this project was to learn Swift, learn to work with Xcode and publish my first iOS app.

The app was published on october 2018 on the the iOS App Store.

Overall, it is a game where the player has to guess a generated number on the device. The user can choose 3 levels of difficulty at the start of each game and that determines how many attempts one has to guess the number. If they got a lucky guess they earn a certain amount of points which allows to get to the next level.
